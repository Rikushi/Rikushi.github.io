        <p>Metropolitan Manila encompasses six cities and 12 towns.

             by the Pasig River, the capital of the Philippines is historic 
             and modern, rich and poor. A popular sight is the walled area 
             called Intramuros. The capital during Spanish colonization, 
             Intramuros has retained old dungeons and gunpowder rooms but 
             added art galleries and theaters. The city is filled with museums, 
             shops, parks and churches, plus enough nightlife to last until dawn.
