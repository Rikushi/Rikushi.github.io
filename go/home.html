        <h1>Philippines</h1>
        <p>Our most Beloved Country in Southeast Asia</p>
        <p>The Philippines is defined by its emerald rice fields, 
          teeming megacities, graffiti-splashed jeepneys, smouldering volcanoes,
          bug-eyed tarsiers, fuzzy water buffalo and smiling, happy-go-lucky people.
        </p> 
        <h3>Island Hopping</h1>
        <p>With more than 7000 tropical islands to choose from, 
          the Philippines is a beach bum's delight. There's an island to suit every taste, 
          from marooned slicks of sand in the middle of the ocean, to volcanic fantasy-scapes 
          concealing hidden lagoons, to sprawling mega-islands such as Luzon and Mindanao. 
          Sun worshippers and divers should head straight to the Visayas, 
          where island-hopping opportunities abound and the perfect beach 
          takes many forms. More adventurous travellers can pitch a tent 
          on a deserted stretch of coastline in Palawan and play solo Survivor for a few days.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Great places</h3>
          <p>Famous for its beaches. While surfers are just catching on to 
            the tasty waves that form on both coasts, 
            divers have long been enamoured of the country's underwater 
            charms. 
            Northern Palawan is perfect for sea kayakers, and 
            Boracay and Pagudpud (North Luzon) are world-class kiteboarding destinations. 
            Back on terra firma, trekking can be done just about anywhere, while mountain-bike 
            and canyoneering tours are gaining popularity. And the Philippines is also, unofficially, 
            the zipline capital of the world.
